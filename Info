/INFORMATION: CrystalClientB1\
Crystal ClientB1 currently has nothing. It's literally not even the game of minecraft yet. B1 was created on 26/07/21, so this is just early release. You can literally just get 
Optifine or just vanilla minecraft and name it something like 'release CrystalClient'.

SPOILER AHEAD!
--------------------

/INFORMATION: CrystalClientB2\ 
CrystalClientB2, this will actually have minecraft in it. Potentially there will be a couple modifications. First hacks will most likely be ESP and tracers as that is probably the
easiest to do. B2 will not be the best client ever as it will have limited mods/hacks. This should release within 2 weeks or so, if not there may be a problem coding it.
